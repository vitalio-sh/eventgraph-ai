# EventGraph AI

**Smart event networking agent** that recommends Bay Area tech events and identifies high-value people to meet, with personalized ice-breakers. Powered by Neo4j graph algorithms and Claude Opus 4.6 via GMI Cloud.

> Built for [HackBay](https://lu.ma/hackbay) hackathon, March 2026.

## What It Does

Paste your LinkedIn profile (or any bio text) and EventGraph AI will:

1. **Parse** your profile into structured skills, interests, and goals
2. **Query** a knowledge graph of 234 Bay Area events + 1,785 LinkedIn-enriched attendees
3. **Score** events and people using real graph algorithms (PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, Louvain Community Detection)
4. **Rank** recommendations using LLM reasoning informed by graph signals
5. **Generate** personalized ice-breaker conversation starters for each person
6. **Visualize** your position in the event network graph

Results stream progressively via SSE — you see each stage complete in real time.

## Graph-Powered Intelligence

This isn't just pattern matching. EventGraph AI runs **real graph algorithms** on the knowledge graph:

| Algorithm                  | What It Finds                                    | How It's Used                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PageRank**               | Network influence — recursively important people | Prioritize well-connected attendees                     |
| **Betweenness Centrality** | Bridge connectors between communities            | Find people who can introduce you to new networks       |
| **Louvain Communities**    | Skill/event clusters                             | Recommend events with cross-community diversity         |
| **2nd-Degree Discovery**   | People connected through shared skill neighbors  | Surface non-obvious connections via multi-hop traversal |
| **Shortest Path**          | How you connect to each person                   | Show connection paths in the UI                         |
| **Jaccard Similarity**     | Skill overlap ratio                              | Quantify profile alignment                              |

### Graph Pre-Ranking

Before any LLM call, candidates are scored using a graph composite formula:

```
score = 0.30 * skill_overlap + 0.25 * pagerank + 0.20 * betweenness
       + 0.10 * multi_event_presence + 0.15 * company_and_discovery_bonus
```

The LLM receives pre-ranked candidates and writes the personalized "why" text — it doesn't do the heavy sorting.

## Architecture

```
User Input (profile text + date range)
        |
        v
[Agent 1: Profile Parser]     ── Haiku ──>  Structured UserProfile JSON
        |
        v
[Agent 2: Graph Query Engine]  ── Neo4j ──>  Events + Candidates + GDS Scores
        |                         (PageRank, Betweenness, Louvain, 2nd-degree)
        v
[Agent 3: Ranking Agent]       ── Opus ───>  Graph-informed ranked recommendations
        |
        v
[Agent 4: Ice-Breaker Agent]   ── Sonnet ─>  Per-person conversation starters
        |
        v
[SSE Stream]                   ── React ──>  Progressive card-based UI
```

**Model tiering** for speed: Haiku (parse, ~2s) → Opus (rank, ~30s) → Sonnet (ice-breakers, ~15s).

**GDS caching**: Graph algorithm scores are cached in-memory (10-min TTL) so subsequent requests skip the 75s GDS computation.

## Neo4j Knowledge Graph

The graph contains **33,833 nodes** and **57,101 relationships**:

```
Person (1,785) ──ATTENDS──> Event (234)
Person ──HAS_SKILL──> Skill (6,028)
Person ──WORKS_AT──> Company (8,882)
Person ──HAS_EXPERIENCE──> Experience (12,746) ──AT_COMPANY──> Company
Person ──HAS_EDUCATION──> Education (3,714)
Event ──HOSTED_BY──> Host (285)
Event ──IN_CITY──> City (21)
Event ──ON_DATE──> Date (7)
Event ──ORGANIZED_BY──> Organizer (131)
```

Events span March 30 – April 5, 2026, sourced from Luma with full LinkedIn-enriched attendee profiles.

| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Profile parse     | ~2s (Haiku)          | ~2s               |
| Graph query + GDS | ~80s                 | ~3s               |
| LLM ranking       | ~30s (Opus)          | ~30s              |
| Ice-breakers      | ~15s (Sonnet)        | ~15s              |
| **Total**         | **~2 min**           | **~49s**          |

GDS scores (PageRank, Betweenness, Louvain) are cached in-memory with a 10-minute TTL.
